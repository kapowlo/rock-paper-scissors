# rock-paper-scissors

odin's project:goal is to make a very simple rock paper scissors game.
This is my first javascript program.
I will be making a simple rock-paper-scissors game from scratch
In this current version we wont add any graphical user interface.
So, everything will simply be displayed in my web browser's console.
But later on I will come back to this project and add a graphical user interface.
UPDATE
I added three buttons and click events.So, now the user can click on the buttons instead of typing:
rock paper scissors every time.
I also used some more DOM manipulation to add some paragraph that display some information each round
I will come back and update it and make the code better as I learn more
